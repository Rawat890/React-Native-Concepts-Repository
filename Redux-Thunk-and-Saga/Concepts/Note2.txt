Which function or component used by component to subscribe to store

In a React-Redux application, components subscribe to the Redux store to access the state and receive updates when the state changes. There are two primary ways components can subscribe to the store:

1. useSelector Hook (Functional Components)
The useSelector hook is used in functional components to subscribe to the Redux store and extract specific pieces of state.

It takes a selector function as an argument, which receives the entire Redux state and returns the specific part of the state the component needs.

Whenever the selected state changes, the component will re-render.

import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Component = () => {
  // Subscribe to the counter value in the Redux store
  const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter);

  return <div>Counter: {counter}</div>;
};

2. connect Function (Class Components)
The connect function is used in class components to subscribe to the Redux store.

It takes two arguments:

mapStateToProps: A function that maps the Redux state to the component's props.

mapDispatchToProps: A function that maps action creators to the component's props.

The connect function returns a higher-order component (HOC) that wraps the original component and provides the Redux state and actions as props.
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class Component extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Access the counter value from props
    const { counter } = this.props;
    return <div>Counter: {counter}</div>;
  }
}

// Map Redux state to component props
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  counter: state.counter,
});

// Connect the component to the Redux store
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Component);
Key Differences
Feature	useSelector Hook	connect Function
Component Type	Functional Components	Class Components
State Access	Directly via selector function	Via mapStateToProps
Re-rendering	Automatically re-renders on state change	Re-renders when props change
Performance	Optimized with shallow comparison	Requires manual optimization
Ease of Use	Simpler and more concise	More verbose
How Subscribing Works
Subscription Setup:

When a component uses useSelector or connect, it subscribes to the Redux store.

The store keeps track of all subscribed components.

State Update:

When an action is dispatched and the state is updated, the store notifies all subscribed components.

Re-rendering:

The component re-renders if the selected state (via useSelector or mapStateToProps) has changed.

Example in Your Scenario
In your example:

Component 1, Component 2, and Component 3 can use either useSelector (for functional components) or connect (for class components) to subscribe to the Redux store and access the counter value.

When the button in Component 1 is clicked, it dispatches an action to update the counter value in the store.

Component 2 and Component 3 will re-render if they are subscribed to the counter value and it changes.
